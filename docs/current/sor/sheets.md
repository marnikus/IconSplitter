# Single sheets — current behaviour

See [invariants/core.md](invariants/core.md), [sheet selectors](../selectors/sheets.md), [storage](STORAGE.md), and [test owners](TESTS.md).

## Behaviour

Single sheets:

* Drop or choose image files (PNG/JPG/WEBP). Non-images are filtered with a message.
* Each sheet is analyzed (background colour, ink mask, threshold) and icons are
  detected automatically; merge distance is adjustable per sheet with an auto default.
* Detected boxes render over the sheet preview; clicking a box toggles exclude/include.
* Export: every included icon becomes a centred square (largest icon side +
  padding %), optionally transparent, optionally fixed size; delivered as ZIP,
  individual downloads, folder save, or single-icon clipboard copy.

## State

One in-memory model, owned by `App`:

```
sheets: Sheet[]       Sheet = { id, name, base, url, img, an: Analysis,
                                boxes: Box[], autoFrac, usedFrac, manual,
                                excluded: number[] }
activeId              which sheet is shown
padding, size, transparent   export options (ExportOpts)
busy: string | null   progress surface (RULE 5)
toast: {msg, err}     honest reporting surface (RULE 2, RULE 4)
```

Detection state transitions per sheet: `loaded → analyzed → detected(auto) →
[redetected(manual frac)…]`. `excluded` is a flag set over intact `boxes`
(RULE 11); only sheet removal destroys detection work.

## Flow

Single sheets:

* **Add sheets:** files → filter non-images → `loadImage` → `analyze` →
  `detect(an, null)` → sheet appended, first becomes active.
* **Review:** preview grid + SVG boundary overlay (`box-toggle-{i}`), merge
  slider re-runs `detect` with a manual fraction, `merge-reset` returns to auto.
* **Export all:** `collect()` loops sheets × included boxes → `renderIcon` →
  `canvasToBlob` (RULE 15 gate) → ZIP / sequential downloads / folder handles;
  `busy` reports `Rendering d/t…` per item (RULE 5); per-item failure is
  reported, never silently swallowed.
* **Single icon:** copy to clipboard or download one rendered blob.

`src/sheets/importSheets.ts` owns the real import/decode/detection loop and per-image failure isolation; App supplies the state sinks. Imports and exports use the [shared completion cue](process-progress.md#completion-sound-on-every-tab), independent of the visible tab.
