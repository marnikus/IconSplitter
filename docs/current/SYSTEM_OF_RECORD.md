# System of Record — Icon Splitter

Current behaviour, invariants and flows. If code and this doc disagree, one of
them is wrong — fix the wrong one in the same change (AGENT_RULES RULE 17).
Adapted structure from `Process-Images-in-Areana/docs/current/SYSTEM_OF_RECORD.md`.

<!-- ideal-size: 357 lines reason=RULE 17 forbids a second current doc, so all four
     modes' authoritative behaviour lives in this one file; per-mode design detail
     stays in docs/archive/ instead of growing here. -->

## 1. What this is

A browser app with four modes (top tabs, `src/ui/Workbench.tsx`):

1. **Single sheets** — detect individual icons in a sprite sheet, review,
   resize and exclude them, export equal-size square PNGs (ZIP / downloads /
   folder / clipboard).
2. **Batch folders** (Chrome/Edge only, File System Access API) — pick a root
   folder, recursively scan every `*_AI*` image, review and select them, split
   each into its own organised output tree beside the sources, with presets
   and per-reference JSON status tracking.
3. **Selection** (Chrome/Edge only) — recursively scan a root, pair every
   original with its `_AI` result, review them side by side and store an
   approve/decline decision per pair in `review-decisions.json`.
4. **Selection V2** (Chrome/Edge only) — the same discovery, decisions and
   decision file as mode 3, presented as the template-driven
   `design temp/selection tab V2/v2 selection tab.html` design: a full-width
   **list review** with paired thumbnails, a thumbnail zoom slider, real
   multi-selection and bulk approve, plus a switchable **comparison** layout.

Stack: React 19 + Vite 7 + TypeScript + Tailwind 4, `jszip` for archives.
Production build is one self-contained `dist/index.html`
(`vite-plugin-singlefile`) that runs offline with no server (RULE 20).

## 2. Current behaviour (authoritative)

Single sheets:

* Drop or choose image files (PNG/JPG/WEBP). Non-images are filtered with a message.
* Each sheet is analyzed (background colour, ink mask, threshold) and icons are
  detected automatically; merge distance is adjustable per sheet with an auto default.
* Detected boxes render over the sheet preview; clicking a box toggles exclude/include.
* Export: every included icon becomes a centred square (largest icon side +
  padding %), optionally transparent, optionally fixed size; delivered as ZIP,
  individual downloads, folder save, or single-icon clipboard copy.

Batch folders:

* Pick a source root (readwrite handle). Recursively scans all images; the
  output folder `_split_output` is ignored during scans (configurable list).
* Only `name_AI.ext` images with an optional numeric tail (`name_AI_7.ext`,
  `name_AI_9_01.ext` — the shapes batch outputs use) are eligible; the reference
  `name.ext` is linked, never processed, and copied into every `split_NN`
  subfolder. Missing reference → warning + user may skip or continue.
* Review window: thumbnail, filename, relPath, status badge
  (unprocessed/processed/skipped/changed/missing/deleted), checkbox, Select/Deselect All.
* Presets store every configurable value (source/dest handles in IndexedDB,
  config in localStorage); last-used preset restores automatically.
* Processing: rescan runs before each batch; per-item progress, per-item
  failure isolation, Stop button honoured between items.
* Output tree: `<root>/_split_output/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss/<src-hierarchy>/<src-stem>/split_NN/<stem>_NN.png`
  (+ reference copy), or the same structure directly inside a custom destination.
  Never overwrites; collisions get `_v02…` appended after any existing `_AI_7`.
* State JSON `<base>.json` lives beside the reference; refreshed after every
  scan and batch; corrupt payloads are rejected and rebuilt (RULE 13).
* "Open in File Explorer" is impossible from a browser — the action copies the
  path and says so honestly (RULE 4/9).

Selection:

* Recursive scan pairs `name.ext` with `name_AI.ext` incl. numeric tails
  (`name_AI_9_01.ext`; stable `pair_<hash>` ids, dir-scoped); unpaired files surface as
  "AI result missing" / "Original missing", never silently dropped.
* Review list: thumbnail, filename, relative folder, creation date, status
  chip with text + glyph; search, month / custom-range date filters, status
  filter, sorting by date/status/name/path in both directions, counters.
* Comparison: side-by-side panes with preserved aspect ratio, dims / format /
  size / path per side, 1:1 zoom with synced scrolling, hotkeys A/D/arrows/
  Space/Ctrl+K, auto-advance to the next pending after each decision.
* Decisions persist in `<root>/review-decisions.json` (atomic tmp-verify-
  overwrite protocol); missing file is created pending; corrupt file raises a
  warning and previous in-memory decisions are kept; write failures keep the
  change in memory with a Retry action.
* Rescan diffs added/renamed/removed/unchanged; decisions travel across
  renames via size+mtime identity; orphan records are retained so a
  transiently missing file never destroys a decision.
* A watcher re-scans every 30 s while a root is open (toggleable).

Selection V2 (adds to, never replaces, the rules above):

* Two layouts over one state: **List review** (full width, no comparison
  panel, one pair per row showing BOTH an Original and an AI result thumbnail,
  each labelled) and **Comparison** (the V1 `CompareView` panes + a pair
  picker). Layout, filters, selection and decisions survive switching.
* Thumbnail zoom: range slider **48–240 px, step 4, default 84** with a live
  "128 px" readout and both bounds shown; row and thumbnail height follow it
  while dragging, width comes from the image's own aspect ratio (never
  stretched, never upscaled past natural height). Persisted across restarts.
* Checkbox selection is separate state keyed by `pair_<hash>`, so sorting and
  filtering never lose it: header checkbox (checked / unchecked /
  indeterminate), Select visible, Deselect all, and live counts for selected,
  visible, checked-but-hidden and checked-but-incomplete.
* Bulk review — **Approve selected** / **Approve visible list**: the affected
  count is shown and the button arms before applying (Escape or Cancel
  disarms); one operation = one transition, one file write, one toast. A
  failed write keeps the change in memory with Retry.
* The **active row** (keyboard target, `aria-current`, scrolled into view) is
  distinct from a **checked row** (bulk target). `A` / `D` decide the active
  row; "Next pending after a decision" advances it.
* Extra filter: **Pairing** = all / complete / missing pair.

Everything runs client-side; nothing is uploaded anywhere.

## 3. State model

One in-memory model, owned by `App`:

```
sheets: Sheet[]       Sheet = { id, name, base, url, img, an: Analysis,
                                boxes: Box[], autoFrac, usedFrac, manual,
                                excluded: number[] }
activeId              which sheet is shown
padding, size, transparent   export options (ExportOpts)
busy: string | null   progress surface (RULE 5)
toast: {msg, err}     honest reporting surface (RULE 2, RULE 4)
```

Detection state transitions per sheet: `loaded → analyzed → detected(auto) →
[redetected(manual frac)…]`. `excluded` is a flag set over intact `boxes`
(RULE 11); only sheet removal destroys detection work.

Batch model (`useBatch.ts`):

```
root, dest              FileSystemDirectoryHandles (dest null => auto)
rows: Row[]             Row = AiImageEntry + status + selected
keys: StateKey[]        which <base>.json files are known
preset                  Preset (split settings, ignore list, dest mode…)
busy / toast            progress + honest reporting surfaces
```

Status transitions per source record: `unprocessed → processed | skipped |
deleted`; file changed → `changed` (re-selectable); file gone at scan → `missing`
(retained in JSON); gone during processing → `deleted` (skipped safely, batch
continues).

Selection V2 model (`useSelectionV2` wraps `useSelection`, so decision,
filter and persistence state are V1's and stay single-owned):

```
core: SelectionApi      discovery, pairs + decisions, filter, sort,
                        active row (core.selectedId), write status
checked: string[]       checkbox selection (pair ids) — never a decision
prefs: ReviewPrefs      { mode: "list"|"compare", thumbHeight: 48..240 }
derived                 header check state, bulk scope
                        { affected, blocked, hidden }
```

## 4. Core flows

Single sheets:

* **Add sheets:** files → filter non-images → `loadImage` → `analyze` →
  `detect(an, null)` → sheet appended, first becomes active.
* **Review:** preview grid + SVG boundary overlay (`box-toggle-{i}`), merge
  slider re-runs `detect` with a manual fraction, `merge-reset` returns to auto.
* **Export all:** `collect()` loops sheets × included boxes → `renderIcon` →
  `canvasToBlob` (RULE 15 gate) → ZIP / sequential downloads / folder handles;
  `busy` reports `Rendering d/t…` per item (RULE 5); per-item failure is
  reported, never silently swallowed.
* **Single icon:** copy to clipboard or download one rendered blob.

Batch:

* **Scan:** root handle → `readDirTree` (ignore list) → `walkTree` →
  `collectAiImages` → `linkReferences` → `syncAndCollect` rewrites every
  `<base>.json` → rows render with statuses.
* **Process:** selection → rescan-derived items → `planBatch` (collision-safe
  folders) → per item: load → `splitSheet` → write `split_NN/<stem>_NN.png`
  via no-overwrite writes → copy reference per split dir → `applyOutcomes`
  persists statuses → UI mirrors (RULE 24). Stop is honoured between items.
* **Presets:** save/load/delete in localStorage; directory handles persisted
  in IndexedDB per preset name; last-used preset auto-restores on open.

## 5. Invariants

* **I-1 (RULE 6):** every export contains exactly the currently included boxes
  of currently loaded sheets.
* **I-2 (RULE 4):** "no icons detected" and "image could not be read" are
  distinct honest states — never a fake success.
* **I-3 (RULE 11):** exclusion never destroys detection work.
* **I-4 (RULE 15):** a blob is delivered only after canvas dims > 0, blob
  non-null, size > 0; otherwise the item is skipped with an error.
* **I-5 (RULE 20):** image bytes never leave the browser.
* **I-6 (RULE 22):** export names derive from one function: sanitized sheet
  base + `-icon-NN.png`, deterministic detection order.
* **I-7 (RULE 24):** every visible value mirrors current state at the moment
  of change — no value waits for another interaction to become visible.
* **I-8 (batch, RULE 23):** batch outputs never overwrite: dirs/files are
  probed `create:false` first; collisions take `_v02…`; existing `_AI_7`
  variant suffixes are preserved, never replaced.
* **I-9 (batch, RULE 6):** the `_split_output` tree is never scanned as input;
  filtered-out (missing/deleted) sources never enter a batch.
* **I-10 (batch, RULE 13):** state JSON is validated on read; corrupt payloads
  are replaced with fresh valid state, never fatal.
* **I-11 (batch, RULE 1/3):** pixel math in batch mode reuses `lib/detect` +
  `lib/render` through `splitSheet` — no second detection implementation.
* **I-12 (selection, RULE 13):** a corrupt or unwritable decision file never
  destroys decisions — in-memory records win, the user is warned, retry offered.
* **I-13 (selection, RULE 4):** "generated" never implies "approved"; a pair
  without a stored decision is pending, always.
* **I-14 (selection, a11y):** every status is text + glyph first; colour is
  reinforcement, never the only signal.
* **I-15 (selection V2, RULE 6/4):** a bulk decision touches exactly
  `checked ∩ visible ∩ complete`; hidden checks are counted and reported,
  never applied, and an incomplete pair is never approved silently.
* **I-16 (selection V2, RULE 24):** the zoom slider, the row height and the
  thumbnail height are one value; moving the slider changes all three in the
  same render, and the stored value survives a restart.

## 6. Storage map

| Where | What | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| localStorage `iconSplitter.presets.v1` | preset list (JSON) | validated on read (RULE 13) |
| localStorage `iconSplitter.lastPreset.v1` | last-used preset name | restores on boot |
| IndexedDB `iconSplitter/handles` | source/dest directory handles per preset | permission re-requested on restore |
| `<refDir>/<base>.json` | per-reference source status records | rewritten after every scan/batch; app-owned, overwrite allowed |
| `<root>/_split_output/…` or custom dest | batch outputs | never overwritten (I-8) |
| `<root>/review-decisions.json` | selection approve/decline records | atomic write; corrupt → warn + keep memory (I-12) |
| IndexedDB `iconSplitter/handles["__selection__"]` | selection root handle (shared by both Selection tabs) | permission re-requested on restore |
| localStorage `iconSplitter.selectionV2.prefs.v1` | V2 view prefs `{ mode, thumbHeight }` | validated + clamped on read (RULE 13) |

Object URLs from user files are revoked on sheet removal (sheets mode).

Direction: UI → batch/selection → lib, never upwards (RULE 1, RULE 3).

## 8. Tests — what exists and what must exist (RULE 8)

Exists (`tests/`, 30 files / 207 tests; canvas shims serve synthetic pixels,
in-memory fakes implement the FS handle interfaces, one happy-dom smoke test
renders the Selection panel and drives it with hotkeys):

* `detect.test.ts` — box count, margins, radius merge/split, dust filter, reading order
* `analyze.test.ts` — background/threshold/mask/ink, transparency-as-white, downscale, analyze→detect end-to-end
* `render.test.ts` — squareInfo/cropRect geometry
* `render_icon.test.ts` — sizing/clamps, bg fill + neighbour wipe + restore, transparent pass, blob gate
* `naming.test.ts` — `_AI` parse, reference derivation, split/variation names, batch path
* `scan.test.ts` — recursive walk + ignore, eligibility, ref linking, scan diff
* `statefile.test.ts` — merge semantics, statuses, corrupt-payload rejection
* `presets.test.ts` — defaults, validation clamps, list round-trip, apply
* `output_plan.test.ts` — layout, `_vNN` collisions, existing-folder respect
* `fs.test.ts` — tree read, no-overwrite write, nested dirs, copy (fakes)
* `batchsplit.test.ts` — one blob per icon, honest empty sheet
* `process.test.ts` — full output tree, deleted/failed isolation, stop, ref copy
* `statewrite.test.ts` — per-reference JSON write, missing retention, corrupt replace
* `store.test.ts` — preset persistence, corrupt rejection, last-used name
* `pairing.test.ts` — nested pairing, variants, duplicates, unpaired sides, ids
* `reviewfilter.test.ts` — month/custom ranges (inclusive, either anchor), status+search
* `reviewsort.test.ts` — all sort modes × directions, status meta, hotkeys
* `reviewfile.test.ts` — corrupt/valid parse, orphans, rename carry, diff
* `reviewstore.test.ts` — missing/corrupt load, atomic write + failure path
* `selection_state.test.ts` — applyScan/withDecision/nextPending/counters
* `handles.test.ts`, `fmt.test.ts` — path resolution, formatters
* `selection_ui.test.tsx` — DOM smoke: pick → list → A/D hotkeys → text chips
* `reviewselect.test.ts`, `reviewbulk.test.ts`, `reviewprefs.test.ts`,
  `selection_bulk.test.ts`, `hotkeys.test.ts`, `copypath.test.ts` — V2 rules:
  selection incl. indeterminate, bulk scope + one summary line, zoom clamp /
  no-upscale / corrupt prefs, bulk reducer, shared hotkeys, path fallback
* `selectionv2_ui.test.tsx` — DOM: recursive scan + both thumbnails, layout
  switch, active row + A/D + auto-next, zoom bounds/value/persistence,
  selection across filter + sort, approve selected/visible, incomplete pairs
  out of scope, save failure + retry, empty/no-match, corrupt JSON, rescan,
  restart persistence, a11y labels

Must exist before the matching change ships:

* any new exported lib/batch function → a test that fails if it is deleted
* sheet/batch UI flows → component tests using `UI_SELECTORS.md` handles when first needed
* ZIP/folder export → assertion on names + count (I-6/I-8), not just "no throw"

## 9. Quality gates summary (RULE 16 — thresholds frozen)

| Gate | Fail line | Tool |
|---|---:|---|
| Function LOC | > 30 | `tools/quality.mjs` |
| Params | > 4 | same |
| Cyclomatic complexity | > 10 | same + eslint warn |
| Nesting | > 4 | same + eslint warn |
| File lines | > 300 (warn), ratchet growth fails | same |
| Coverage `src/lib` | lines ≥ 80%, never decrease | vitest v8 |
| Anti-gaming | `partN` helpers always fail | same |

Workflow and ratchet: `CODE_VERIFICATION.md`. Dated re-checks: `QUALITY_RECHECK.md`.

## 10. History of designs — pointers

* 2026-09-30 — rules adopted from `marnikus/Process-Images-in-Areana`
  `docs/current/*` (AGENT_RULES 24 rules, CODE_VERIFICATION, DOM_SELECTORS →
  UI_SELECTORS, QUALITY_RECHECK); metrics reports intentionally not ported.
* 2026-10-01 — batch processing designed TDD-first:
  `docs/archive/2026-10-01-batch-processing/design.md` (module map, browser
  constraints, rule budget, negative tests).
* 2026-10-01 — Selection review designed TDD-first:
  `docs/archive/2026-10-01-selection-review/design.md` (pairing model, atomic
  decision protocol, rename carry, hotkeys, a11y).
* 2026-10-01 — Selection review V2 designed TDD-first from the prepared HTML
  template: `docs/archive/2026-10-01-selection-v2/design.md` (layering, list
  review rows, zoom slider, selection vs decision state, bulk scope, a11y
  deviation from the template's `role="listbox"`).

## 11. Current UI — control inventory

Full handle reference with semantic fallbacks: `UI_SELECTORS.md`.

* Workbench: `tab-sheets`, `tab-batch`.
* Sheets mode: header (upload + 3 export buttons), Sheets, Export settings
  (padding/size/transparent), Detection (merge slider + reset), Boundary
  overlay, Result grid, busy overlay, toast.
* Batch mode: header controls (`batch-root`, `batch-refresh`, `batch-process`,
  `batch-cancel`), PresetBar (name/save/list/delete + split settings), Dest
  info, review window (`scan-table`, `select-all`, per-row checkbox/actions),
  reference warnings, busy overlay, toast.
* Selection mode: header (`sel-root`, `sel-rescan`, `sel-watcher`, counters,
  help), FilterBar (date modes + From/To, status, sort, order, clear), review
  list (`sel-list`, `sel-search`, `sel-row-*`), comparison (`sel-compare`,
  Approve/Decline, 1:1/SYNC, per-side Open-in-Explorer), status footer
  (`sel-footer`), write/corrupt banners, busy + toast.
* Selection V2 mode: source bar (`v2-root`, `v2-rescan`, `v2-watcher`,
  `v2-mode-list` / `v2-mode-compare`, `v2-count-*`), filter grid (`v2-date-*`,
  `v2-from` / `v2-to`, `v2-status`, `v2-pairing`, `v2-sort`, `v2-dir`,
  `v2-shown`, `v2-clear`), bulk bar (`v2-check-all`, `v2-selected-count`,
  `v2-scope`, `v2-blocked`, `v2-hidden`, `v2-select-visible`, `v2-deselect`,
  `v2-thumb` + `v2-thumb-value`, `v2-approve-selected`, `v2-approve-visible`),
  list (`v2-list`, `v2-rows`, `v2-row-*`, `v2-check-*`, `v2-thumb-src` /
  `v2-thumb-ai`, `v2-status-*`, `v2-open-{src,ai}-*`, `v2-decline-*` /
  `v2-approve-row-*`, `v2-autonext`, `v2-empty`, `v2-nomatch`), comparison
  (`v2-pair-picker` + the V1 `sel-compare` handles), shared surfaces
  (`v2-writewarn` / `v2-retry`, `v2-corrupt`, `v2-toast`, `v2-busy` and the
  shared `sel-footer` / `sel-diff` / `sel-retry-count`). Full table:
  `UI_SELECTORS.md` §N.
